The Recording Academy and IBM worked together to integrate Watson’s artificial intelligence into the red-carpet experience at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. Through the partnership, the production and curation of content flowed more efficiently across TV, social media, and digital platforms and generated “more engaging fan features”. During the five-hour celebrity procession, Watson used the Cognitive Fashion APIs to understand styles, learn about this year’s fashion trends and compare them to those of previous years. The tool was built by the US iX team, used Visual Search, Visual Browse, and Dominant Color APIs from IBM Research AI. The tool was well received garnering significant coverage from press and social media.
